## This is how you tell RStudio to log in to github

You log in to github online and go to "account-->settings-->developer settings -->personal access tokens--> TOkens(classic) -->generate new token-->write what token has access to and generate-->copy and paste toke into gitcreds_set()"

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
install.apckages('gitcreds')
librarY(gitcreds)
gitcreds_set()
```
