## This is how you tell RStudio to log in to github

You log in to github online and go to "account-->settings-->developer settings -->personal access tokens--> TOkens(classic) -->generate new token-->write what token has access to and generate-->copy and paste toke into gitcreds_set()"

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
install.apckages('gitcreds')
librarY(gitcreds)
gitcreds_set()
```


## When you knwo whatever you have on your local r is the correct thing that needs to go to git

git -f (#to force merge to remote)
git push -force


## When your pushes/commits are not wokring and you get ahead by too many commits and your github stalls

git reset HEAD~2 #= for how many commits you want to remove

## SHould a file stay on the cloud or stay on your local machine
git status (will tell you which files are giving you the problems)
git add "file"
