## This is how you tell RStudio to log in to github

You log in to github online and go to "account-->settings-->developer settings -->personal access tokens--> TOkens(classic) -->generate new token-->write what token has access to and generate-->copy and paste toke into gitcreds_set()"

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
install.apckages('gitcreds')
librarY(gitcreds)
gitcreds_set()
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
